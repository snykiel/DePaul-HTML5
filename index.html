                <h3>Mayor Emanuel and CDPH Launch Healthy
                Chicago Community Seed Grants</h3>
                <p>As part of the City's ongoing work to engage and
                invest in neighborhoods, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the
                Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) announced
                today the new Healthy Chicago Community Seed Grants,
                providing up to six seed grants for community-based
                initiatives to improve health and well-being. The new
                grant opportunities are part of the citywide Healthy
                Chicago 2.0 plan, announced March 29, and will be
                discussed during of a series of community meetings
                hosted by CDPH over the next month.</p>
                <p>"Healthy Chicago 2.0 was designed with our
                communitie's needs in mind to expand innovative
                health strategies and improve the health and vitality
                of each of our residents," said Mayor Emanuel.
                "These new seed grants follow up on that promise
                by focusing on eliminating inequities and ensuring that
                every resident has the resources and opportunities
                necessary to lead a healthy life"</p>
                <p>Under the new effort, CDPH will award up to six
                community seed grants, ranging between $10,000 and
                $20,000, to local non-profit organizations with
                innovative ideas on how to address health disparities
                at a community-level. Awards will be based on how
                closely programs align with the goals of Healthy
                Chicago 2.0, a data-driven plan that identifies key
                areas of improvement across the city.</p>
                <p>"The best way to improve our city's health
                is to engage the people who live here," said CDPH
                Commissioner Julie Morita, M.D." By providing seed
                grants and by holding these community meetings, we will
                work directly with residents to help them improve their
                communities. We look forward to engaging our residents
                firsthand on how we can improve services to meet their
                needs and improve quality of life in their
                communities."</p>
                <p>Building on the success of 2011's Healthy
                Chicago plan, Healthy Chicago 2.0 provides strategies
                to address traditional health issues as well as
                systemic issues associated with poor health - including
                housing, education and transportation - and focuses on
                neighborhoods and demographic groups that continue to
                face significant health disparities. The Public Health
                Institute of Metropolitan Chicago in partnership with
                CDPH will release the grant application later this
                month which will be available at
                www.cityofchicago.org/health.</p>
                <p>The series of community meetings will bring together
                CDPH officials, local leaders and community residents
                to discuss both challenges and solutions regarding
                health, focusing specifically on issues that are
                relevant to each community. CDPH will use feedback from
                the meetings to further implementation of Healthy
                Chicago 2.0. The meetings, listed below, are open to
                the public and refreshments will be served</p>

                <h3>May 4, 2016</h3>
                <h3>Chicago, a modern metropolis on the
                shores of Lake Michigan that's defined by
                a love for fine art, baseball and the blues</h3>
                <p>Stroll museums and parks filled with art, and catch
                live blues any night of the week in
                Chicago's bustling Downtown district. Or
                catch a lively sports game in this home to the Cubs and
                White Sox baseball teams, and the Chicago Bulls
                basketball team.</p>
                <p>This metropolis is the third largest city in
                America, but getting around is easy thanks to the
                efficient above ground train, the 'L'.
                Get your bearings from
                the tallest skyscraper in the US, Willis Tower, which
                defines the city's skyline. The viewing
                platform, 1,353 feet (412 meters) above the busy
                streets, offers unparalleled vistas of Lake Michigan,
                Navy Pier, and other main attractions.</p>
                <p>Lincoln Park, just north of downtown, has beaches,
                sporting grounds and landscaped gardens. Soak up the
                history of the Windy City at the Chicago History
                Museum, located on the southern end of the park. Take a
                stroll through the indoor gardens of the Lincoln Park
                Conservatory, or spend an afternoon at the Lincoln Park
                Zoo. This public zoo houses more than 1,000 animals.
                Brookfield Zoo, 12 miles west of the city center, is
                more than double the size and features dolphin
                displays, big cats, a variety of primates and more.</p>
                <p>Head back into the Loop district downtown for some
                of the best shopping in the city, along Michigan
                Avenue's Magnificent Mile.
                It's a good place for lunch or dinner, or
                people watching while you sip a coffee or beer. Just
                south of the Magnificent Mile is the expansive Art
                Institute of Chicago well worth a visit for its
                collection of European and American masterpieces that
                include Monet, Van Gogh, and much more. Nearby is
                Millennium Park, a meeting place with public art and
                spectacular summer concerts.</p>
                <p>Some of America's most influential
                figures came from Chicago. Visit the Ernest Hemingway
                Museum and House, where the famous writer was born.
                Architect Frank Lloyd Wright's first
                house is in the pretty Oak Park neighborhood (called
                the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio). He designed
                many houses and buildings in the area, including Unity
                Temple, considered one of his best. On your way back
                into town, stop off at the Garfield Park Conservatory,
                an urban oasis of rare and exotic plants.</p>
                <p>No trip to Chicago would be complete without
                catching a baseball game at the legendary Wrigley
                Field. At night, head to Navy Pier, packed with lively
                bars and restaurants. Another option is to head out for
                a night of blues at one of Chicago's legendary
                clubs. Check out B.L.U.E.S. near downtown on
                Chicago's north side or Kingston Mines a few miles
                north near Lincoln Park. Both of these long established
                venues have music every night of the week.</p>

                <h3>Radon Risks Increase During Winter Months, Get Your
                Home Tested</h3>
                <p>January is National Radon Action Month and the
                Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) is
                encouraging Chicagoans to test their home for harmful
                levels of radon. Radon is a naturally-occurring
                colorless, odorless radioactive gas and is the leading
                cause of lung cancer among non-smokers. The best time
                to test homes for radon is during cold-weather months
                when windows are shut and elevated levels of radon are
                more likely to be detected.</p>
                <p>"Exposure to radon causes lung cancer in
                non-smokers and smokers alike," said CDPH
                Commissioner Dr. Julie Morita. "We're calling
                on every Chicagoan to test their home for radon in
                order to help protect themselves and their
                families."</p>
                <p>"Low-cost test kits are available at stores
                throughout the city and online," said Dr. Cortland
                Lohff, CDPH medical director for environmental health.
                &quot;Taking action to test and fix high levels of
                radon gas is not only a strong investment for your
                health but also for your home.&quot;</p>
                <p>Information on how to test, find a qualified radon
                professional or obtain a test kit is available at
                http://www.epa.gov/radon or by calling the Cook County
                Radon Hot Line at (708) 865-6177.</p>
                <p>You can't see, smell or taste radon, but it
                could be present at a dangerous level in your home. In
                fact, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
                estimates that radon causes more than 20,000 deaths
                from lung cancer each year. And if you smoke and your
                home has a high radon level, your risk of lung cancer
                can increase even more.</p>
                <p>Radon comes from the natural decay of uranium that
                is found in nearly all soils. It can get into homes
                through cracks and other holes in the foundation. Radon
                can then be trapped inside the home, where it can build
                up.</p>
                <p>All homes with or without basements should be tested
                for radon. Affordable Do-It-Yourself radon test kits
                are available online and at home improvement and
                hardware stores, or you can hire a qualified radon
                tester.</p>
                <p>CDPH recommends taking action to fix radon levels at
                or above 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L). Addressing
                high radon levels often costs the same as other minor
                home repairs. In most cases, a system with a vent pipe
                and fan is used to reduce radon.</p>
                <p>Improving the health and well-being of all
                Chicagoans by creating safer and healthier homes is a
                priority in CDPH&#39;s citywide health agenda, Healthy
                Chicago. Healthy Chicago sets an ambitious sense of
                purpose for Chicago and engages the city with bold
                action and goals to make Chicago the healthiest city in
                the nation.</p>

                <h3>City Council Passes Ordinance to Combat
                Illegal Tobacco Sales to Prevent Youth Smoking</h3>
                <p>Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced the city of
                Chicago is taking action to keep tobacco out of the
                hands of youth and encourage residents to live smoke
                free. An ordinance passed by the City Council today
                cracks down on the illegal sale of cigarettes across
                Chicago by doubling fines for retailers who sell
                illegal cigarettes.</p>
                <p>"Keeping illegal cigarettes off of our
                streets and out of the hands of our youth helps them
                live longer, healthier lives," Mayor Emanuel
                said. "This ordinance is the latest step
                in our comprehensive effort to reduce smoking among
                Chicago's youth."</p>
                <p>The new ordinance increases fines on retailers who
                sell illegal cigarettes from $1,000 to $2,000 for the
                first offense when fewer than 40 unstamped tobacco
                packs are found. When more than 40 unstamped packs are
                found the fine increases to $50 per pack. Fines are
                raised from $2,000 to $4,000 for any subsequent
                violations. Repeat offenders also face revocation of
                their tobacco license and a one-year tobacco sales ban
                on the location and business owner.</p>
                <p>The new ordinance follows a recently-enacted state
                law that was pushed by the city to make clear that all
                state and local tax stamps are required before the sale
                of cigarettes. Prior to this legislation, possession of
                more than 250 packs of contraband cigarettes was not
                considered a class 4 felony if the Illinois State tax
                stamp was affixed.</p>
                <p>By strengthening the statute, tobacco retailers can
                no longer avoid criminal prosecution by only purchasing
                the state stamp but not the city/county stamp. Since
                the beginning of the year, city inspectors have
                conducted six confiscations where more than 250 packs
                of cigarettes didn't have the required
                stamps for a total of approximately $33,000 in
                fines.</p>
                <p>Under Mayor Emanuel, Chicago has become a national
                leader in tobacco cessation by launching an innovative
                array of programs, laws and tax policies. Chicago has
                the highest cigarette tax in the country at $7.17 per
                pack, imposed new e-cigarette tax which serving as a
                strong disincentive for youth to start smoking. In
                addition to revenue on fines introduced today, the city
                expects to collect $21.6 million in cigarette tax in
                2016.</p>
                <p>"We were seeing a pattern where
                cigarettes had the state tax stamp, but not the city or
                county stamp, so business owners were skirting felony
                charges," BACP Commissioner Maria Guerra
                Lapacek. "This tough ordinance is designed
                to deter this act because even one violation is one too
                many. Doubling the fines for tobacco violators
                continues to send a strong message to irresponsible
                retailers who are bent to on breaking the
                law."</p>
                <p>Under Mayor Emanuel, Chicago has become a national
                leader in tobacco cessation. Since the Mayor first took
                office, youth smoking has decreased to an all-time low.
                According to the CDC's most recent
                numbers, 10.7 percent of Chicago high school students
                have reported smoking, down from 13.6 percent in 2011
                and 24.6 percent in 2001.</p>

                <h3>CDPH Hosts End-of-Year Flu Vaccine
                Clinics for Vaccinate Illinois Week</h3>
                <p>The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) is
                once again teaming up with health departments and
                healthcare organizations throughout Illinois to
                encourage residents to get a flu shot during Vaccinate
                Illinois Week (VIW), December 6 through 12. CDPH joins
                public health officials and healthcare organizations
                next week in recommending that everyone six months of
                age or older receive a flu shot during the fall and
                winter months, when the flu is most common.</p>
                <p>VIW is a statewide observance focused on educating
                the public about the importance of getting a flu
                vaccine during the fall and winter months, and is
                aligned with Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
                recommendations for flu preparedness. VIW grew out of
                Vaccinate Chicago week, which was first launched by
                CDPH in 2012.</p>
                <p>"It's not too late to get a flu shot," said
                CDPH Commissioner Julie Morita, MD. "Flu season
                typically peaks in January and February. Get vaccinated
                now to protect yourself, your friends and your family
                from illness."</p>
                <p>During the fourth-annual VIW, next week Chicago
                residents will see and hear coordinated digital, social
                media, print and broadcast advertisements reminding
                them to get vaccinated this season. Though the flu shot
                does not cover every possible strain of influenza seen
                every season, it still remains the single best
                protection against the flu in general. The vaccines
                available this year protect against the three or four
                strains of influenza that are most likely to cause
                people to get sick.</p>
                <p>Residents can use the CDPH flu shot app to find a
                flu shot clinic nearby or call 311 to locate one of our
                Fast Track Immunization Clinics. CDPH Fast Track
                Clinics provide flu vaccinations at no charge for
                adults of all ages and all children over age six
                months. No appointment is necessary; vaccinations are
                given on a first come, first served basis.</p>
                <p>Among those more vulnerable to complications from
                flu are pregnant women, young children, the elderly and
                anyone with underlying health conditions like asthma,
                diabetes or a weakened immune system. A flu vaccine is
                needed every year because flu viruses are constantly
                changing.</p>
                <p>In addition to getting a flu shot, you can also
                reduce your risk by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Washing your hands regularly with soap and
                    water. If soap and water are not available,
                    use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
                    <li>Avoiding touching your eyes, nose or
                    mouth.</li>
                    <li>Avoiding close contact with sick people. If you
                    are sick, stay home from school or work.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Vaccinate Illinois Week (VIW) is a statewide
                observance of National Influenza Vaccination Week, an
                annual initiative led by the Centers for Disease
                Control (CDC) to educate the public about the
                importance of influenza vaccination throughout the fall
                and winter months. In observance of VIW this year, the
                Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Illinois headquarters in
                Chicago will light up the building with the message
                "Get a flu shot" from December 4 through

                <h3>City to Spray Insecticide Wednesday to
                Kill Mosquitoes to Fight West Nile Virus</h3>
                <p>The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) is
                continuing its efforts against West Nile virus by
                spraying to kill adult mosquitoes in parts of the
                northwest side on Wednesday, September 2nd, 2015. This
                is the third spraying of the season.</p>
                <p>Weather permitting, the spraying will begin at dusk
                on September 2nd and continue through the night until
                approximately 1:00am, with licensed mosquito abatement
                technicians in trucks dispensing an ultra-low-volume
                spray. CDPH staff have been leaving door hangers in the
                affected areas to notify residents that the spraying
                will occur.</p>
                <p>The material being used to control the adult
                mosquitoes, Zenivex, will be applied at a rate
                of 1.5 fluid ounces per acre. It is approved for use by
                the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and is used to
                control mosquitoes in outdoor residential and
                recreational areas.</p>
                <p>Zenivex has been used effectively to
                control disease-carrying mosquitoes and is
                non-persistent, decomposing rapidly in the environment.
                The rapid degradation of this product makes it an
                excellent choice for control of West Nile
                virus-carrying mosquitoes. The spray will be applied by
                licensed mosquito abatement technicians from Vector
                Disease Control International, a leader in the mosquito
                control industry. Guiding the crews through the streets
                will be supervisors from the Chicago Department of
                Streets and Sanitation.</p>
                <p>While the spray is not harmful to people or pets and
                is routinely sprayed in residential areas across the
                nation, residents of targeted neighborhoods may choose
                to stay indoors and close their windows while spraying
                is underway, as an extra precaution.</p>
                <p>Each year, CDPH conducts a comprehensive West Nile
                virus surveillance, prevention and control program. In
                addition to spraying, this includes dropping larvicide
                in catch basins, which helps limit the number of
                mosquitoes that can carry the virus, and regularly
                testing mosquitoes caught in traps throughout the city.
                By utilizing data, the city is able to most efficiently
                target high-risk areas for the virus.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use insect repellent that contains DEET,
                    Picaridin or Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus.</li>
                    <li>Eliminate standing water. This includes
                    emptying water from flowerpots, gutters, pool
                    covers, pet water dishes and birdbaths
                    regularly.</li>
                    <li>Keep grass and weeds short to eliminate hiding
                    places for adult mosquitoes.</li>
                    <li>When outside between dusk and dawn, wear
                    loose-fitting, light colored clothing including
                    long pants, long sleeve shirts, socks and
                    shoes.</li>
                    <li>Check that all screens, windows and doors are
                    tight-fitting and free of holes and tears</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As part of their ongoing response efforts, CDPH will
                continue to collect mosquitoes from traps located
                throughout the city and test these mosquitoes for West
                Nile virus. Using results of these tests, CDPH will
                determine the appropriate steps to be taken in order to
                best protect Chicago residents.</p>

                <h3>City Council Approves Ordinance to
                Expand Citywide Composting Program</h3>
                <p>City Council today approved Mayor
                Emanue's ordinance to expand composting
                operations at community gardens and urban farms across
                Chicago, as well as create a citywide community garden
                registry and urban farm accessory composting operation
                permit. The goal of the program is to expand the type
                of allowable compostable materials at both community
                gardens and urban farms, while implementing common
                sense measures to ensure public health standards are
                maintained.</p>
                <p>"Urban agriculture is an important
                piece in making our communities more environmentally
                friendly and sustainable," said Mayor Rahm
                Emanuel. "Expanding composting is an easy
                way to support our neighborhoods in growing their own
                fresh fruits and vegetables right in their own
                backyards."</p>
                <p>In addition to landscape waste, such as grass or
                shrubbery clippings, community gardens will now be
                allowed to compost limited organic waste, including
                food scraps such as vegetables and eggshells. All
                community gardens will be required to register with the
                City at no-cost through a new online community garden
                registry. The ordinance also creates a new Urban Farm
                Accessory Composting Operation Permit, which will allow
                urban farms to apply for a permit with the Chicago
                Department of Public Health to compost livestock waste,
                in addition to landscape and limited organic waste.</p>
                <p>"Composting supports the reuse of
                material that would otherwise be considered waste and
                sent to landfills," said Commissioner Julie
                Morita, Chicago Department of Public Health.
                "I look forward to implementing these new
                policies and other best practices with our community
                stakeholders in the upcoming composting
                season."</p>
                <p>The ordinance was drafted with input from local
                urban agriculture and environmental stakeholders and
                the City will continue to work with these partners as
                the community is educated about new composting
                opportunities.</p>
                <p>"We applaud Mayor Emanuel for
                introducing this ordinance, created with feedback from
                advocates and cooperative work with City
                departments," said Jen Walling, Executive
                Director, Illinois Environmental Council.
                "This ordinance positions Chicago as one
                of the top cities in the nation for small scale
                composting sites, protecting the environment and
                introducing new tools for urban farmers and
                gardeners."</p>
                <p>Expanding composting is part of a larger strategy to
                support urban agriculture efforts in Chicago. In 2011,
                Mayor Emanuel passed the Urban Farm ordinance,
                expanding the size limit on community gardens, relaxing
                fencing and parking requirements on commercial urban
                farms to help reduce startup costs, and allowing for
                innovative new methods of farming such as hydroponic
                and aquaponic systems. Over the last four years,
                acreage devoted to urban farming has increased by a
                factor of 13, going from 1.4 acres to roughly 18 acres,
                and the number of urban farm operators from 2 to
                13.</p>

                <h3>Mayor Emanuel Announces Divvy Expanding
                Access to Popular Bike Share System</h3>
                <p>Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced today that Divvy is
                breaking down barriers to access the popular bike-share
                program by offering reduced-cost annual memberships to
                residents. Under the new initiative, Divvy for Everyone
                (D4E), Chicago residents with incomes below 300 percent
                of the federal poverty level who don't have a
                credit or debit card will qualify for a $5 annual Divvy
                membership, compared to the regular $75 price. The
                effort follows a major expansion of Divvy to new
                neighborhoods earlier this year, and a record-breaking
                weekend for ridership over the Fourth of July.</p>
                <p>"In two years Divvy has grown to more
                neighborhoods and become a transit option for more
                residents, but cost was still a barrier for too many
                people," said Mayor Emanuel. "Divvy only
                works when everyone has a chance to use it. Today we
                are bridging gaps by offering $5 annual memberships so
                more residents can benefit from Divvy, regardless of
                their ability to pay."</p>
                <p>The D4E program is available to Chicago residents
                who have a maximum combined household income of 300
                percent of the federal poverty level. D4E provides a
                one-time one-year membership for $5 with no credit or
                debit card required. Applicants must appear in person
                at any of five Local Initiatives Support Corporation
                (LISC) Financial Opportunity Centers -
                located in Bronzeville, Englewood, East Garfield Park,
                Humboldt Park and Ravenswood - and
                provide proof of income and Chicago residency. They
                will be charged $5 if found qualified and will be
                issued a Divvy member key on-site.</p>
                <p>The City is exploring a number of options for people
                to be able to continue their memberships at full price
                after the initial year, these include payment plans,
                cash payment options, and a pathway to credit-building
                and financial empowerment programs with LISC Financial
                Opportunity Centers.</p>
                <p>"As a longtime advocate for bike usage in the
                Third Ward -- more specifically in Bronzeville -- I am
                proud to support the Divvy for Everyone program,"
                said 3rd Ward Alderman Pat Dowell. "This
                partnership between CDOT, Divvy, and community agencies
                allows the usage of Divvy Bikes to be more affordable
                for residents across the City of Chicago."</p>
                <p>Divvy is working with two local organizations on D4E
                outreach efforts: Slow Roll Chicago and Go Bronzeville.
                Slow Roll Chicago, which dedicated to building a
                diverse, inclusive and equitable bicycle culture in
                Chicago, is conducting citywide outreach; and Go
                Bronzeville is focused on building local awareness in
                the Bronzeville community.</p>
                <p>"Convenient and affordable
                transportation is a lynchpin to quality of
                life," said Rebekah Scheinfeld, Commissioner of
                the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT), which
                manages Divvy. "Divvy is a transportation
                resource that can help working families save money and
                can often make the difference in terms of providing
                crucial access to jobs. We're very
                excited to be able to expand access to Divvy through
                the D4E Program."</p>

                <h3>December 16, 2014</h3>
                <h3>Mayor's Commission for a Safer
                Chicago Releases Collaborative Anti-Violence
                Report</h3>
                <p>Mayor Rahm Emanuel today joined the members of the
                Mayor's Commission for a Safer Chicago as they
                presented their report and a series of proposals to
                address youth violence. The Commission is an outgrowth
                of a series of three roundtable forums held this
                summer, in which leaders from City government, faith
                groups and community organizations gathered to discuss
                joint efforts to combat gun violence and strengthen
                communities.</p>
                <p>"The powerful work being done between city
                government, community leaders, faith leaders and youth
                is a testament to the fact that the best ideas
                don't necessarily come from city hall," said
                Mayor Emanuel. "Together we have taken important
                steps forward, and I am committed to making sure the
                Commission for a Safer Chicago is a permanent fixture
                in youth violence prevention because their input
                reflects the wisdom and voices of people in
                neighborhoods throughout Chicago."</p>
                <p>The Mayor's Commission for a Safer Chicago
                brings together over 130 City staff, community and
                faith leaders, practitioners, subject matter experts,
                parents, and youth, to provide tangible solutions to
                address youth violence. The group also engaged more
                than 200 youth from 15 Chicago communities in moderated
                discussions, ensure young people's ideas and
                feedback are part of the solutions developed.</p>
                <p>This report, the Commission's first, is the
                result of intensive collaborative work throughout the
                fall of 2014. The Commission was tasked with updating
                for 2015 the City's strategic plan for youth
                violence prevention, with recommendations that build on
                current investments and leverage existing City and
                community resources. In keeping with its shared belief
                that violence is preventable, not inevitable, the
                Commission focused for this report on strategies
                designed to identify and intervene with youth at risk
                for becoming involved in violence.</p>
                <p>"This has been such a great experience,"
                said Evelyn Diaz, Commissioner of the Department of
                Family and Support Services. "People from across
                our city came together not just to talk about the
                problem of violence, but to roll up their sleeves and
                work side by the side with the City to develop
                meaningful solutions."</p>
                <p>The Commission made recommendations in five issue
                areas, each designed to address the risk factors and
                root causes of youth violence - youth employment,
                health and healing, crating restorative school
                communities, safety and justice, and safe spaces and
                activities.</p>
                <p>"Violence prevention isn't just the
                city's responsibility, it is all of our
                responsibility," said Rev. Dr. L. Bernard Jakes.
                "I really think this is a call to action.
                Whatever, your passion, wherever in the City you live,
                there is a way to be involved in the solutions that are
                part of this plan. We thank the Mayor for convening
                this group, for listening to what the community has to
                say, and for working with us to implement these
                ideas."</p>
